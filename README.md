## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension.

### Useful resources

- [Sass Variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables/) - This helped me to assign a value a name that begins with $, and then refer to that name instead of the value itself. Variables make it possible to reduce repetition, do complex math, configure libraries, and much more.
- [Sass Function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/function) - Functions allows to define complex operations on SassScript values that can be re-used throughout a stylesheet. They make it easy to abstract out common formulas and behaviors in a readable way.
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me add the Fraunces and Montserrat fonts.
